#Introduction
TODO: Simple steganography tool, that allows you to quickly pick an image file and an archive and binary copy them into a resulting image that has the contents of the archive hidden inside. Later you can open the image with archiving software (e.g. 7-zip) and extract the hidden file(s). 

#Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation process
    It's a simple executable. So no installation needed ;)
2.	Software dependencies
    Honestly, I've no idea. Probably .net framework 4+
3.	Latest releases
    I just started it so 0.0.1.0 I think.
4.	API references
    Don't really know what this means. Yes, I'm a noob.
#Build and Test
TODO: Describe and show how to build your code and run the tests.
    If I can build it I doubt you won't be able to. 

#Contribute
TODO: Explain how other users and developers can contribute to make your code better.
    If this repo is public, because I have no idea there are no helpful tips for noobs in this whole system.
    So...if it is public, whoever can contribute with some helpful steganography and cryptography code snippets done in C#, it will be highly appreciated.
